# xlr-ansible-automation-controller-plugin
a plugin developed to integrate Ansible Automation Platform Controller API with Digiatal.ai Release

# Overview

The plugin acts as a bridge between Digital.ai Release, a comprehensive release orchestration solution, and Ansible Tower (Ansible Automation Platform Controller). It allows users to incorporate Ansible Tower tasks and playbooks directly into their release pipelines, ensuring smooth integration of infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, and application deployments.

# Interfaces

## Connection / Authentication

The authentication page on the Ansible plugin allows users to securely access the plugin using both Basic Authentication and tokens generated from the Ansible Automation Platform. These authentication methods ensure a seamless integration with Digital.ai Release while maintaining robust security measures.
